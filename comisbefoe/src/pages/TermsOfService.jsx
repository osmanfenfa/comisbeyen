            <p>
              These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between <strong>Bukuma Inc.</strong> ("COMIS," "we," "us," or "our") and the produce-buying business that registers a Produce Manager account (the "Customer," "you," or "your"). COMIS is provided as a Software as a Service (SaaS) — a cloud-hosted platform accessed over the internet, with no installed software licensed to the Customer — and is offered to Customers in Sierra Leone and other countries. By registering an account, accessing, or using the COMIS platform (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not register for or use the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              You represent that you have the authority to bind the business or entity on whose behalf you are registering, and that all information provided during registration is accurate and current.

            <p>
              A Produce Manager account is created via self-service registration and remains in a pending state until approved by a System Admin, as described in the Service's account-approval workflow. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that any Produce Manager it designates has the authority to create and manage Produce Secretary accounts on the Customer's behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Customer must provide accurate business information (business name, address, contact details) during registration and must promptly update this information if it changes. COMIS reserves the right to refuse, suspend, or revoke approval of any account where information provided is false, incomplete, or cannot be verified.

            <p>
              COMIS provides a role-based digital platform for recording cocoa, coffee, and cola nut produce purchases (including automated moisture-deduction and weight-based pricing calculations), managing seller records, managing loans issued to sellers, generating official receipts, tracking bag quantities, recording bulk supplies to buyers, and producing operational reports. The Service is designed to function in offline or intermittent-connectivity conditions, with data synchronization occurring once connectivity is restored.
            </p>
            <p>
              COMIS may add, modify, or remove features of the Service at its discretion, and will make reasonable efforts to notify Customers of material changes that affect core functionality.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">5. User Roles and Customer Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
              The Service enforces three roles: System Admin, Produce Manager, and Produce Secretary, each with defined permissions as described in the Service's documentation. The Customer is solely responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-slate-700">
              <li>Assigning roles appropriately and only to individuals authorized to perform the corresponding functions;</li>
              <li>Ensuring Produce Secretary staff understand that their recorded transactions require Produce Manager review and approval before a receipt is issued;</li>
              <li>Promptly deactivating accounts of staff who no longer work for the Customer or who no longer require access;</li>
              <li>The accuracy of all Seller information, weights, moisture percentages, prices, bag counts, and loan figures entered by its Authorized Users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              COMIS is not responsible for losses arising from a Customer's failure to manage its own Authorized Users' access appropriately, including failure to revoke access from a terminated employee.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">6. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>The Customer agrees that Authorized Users will not:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-slate-700">
              <li>Falsify weight, moisture percentage, price, bag counts, or loan figures with intent to defraud a Seller, the Customer, or any third party;</li>
              <li>Share login credentials between individuals or allow an unauthorized person to access the Service under another user's account;</li>
              <li>Attempt to bypass, disable, or circumvent the Service's role-based permission controls or approval workflow;</li>
              <li>Use the Service to collect, store, or process Seller data for any purpose unrelated to legitimate produce-buying and loan-management operations;</li>
              <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, scrape, or attempt to extract the Service's source code or underlying data structures, except as permitted by law;</li>
              <li>Use the Service in violation of any applicable law of the Republic of Sierra Leone or any other jurisdiction in which the Customer operates.</li>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">7. Fees and Payment</h2>
            <p>
              Current pricing, subscription tiers, and payment terms (if any) will be communicated separately at the time of registration or upgrade. COMIS reserves the right to introduce, modify, or discontinue paid tiers with reasonable advance notice to existing Customers. Fees, once paid, are non-refundable except as required by law or as expressly stated in a separate order form or invoice.
            </p>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">8. Data Ownership and License</h2>
            <p>
              As between the Customer and COMIS, the Customer retains ownership of all Customer Data. The Customer grants COMIS a limited, non-exclusive license to host, process, store, transmit, and display Customer Data solely as necessary to provide, maintain, and improve the Service. COMIS will not sell Customer Data or Seller personal data to third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon termination of the Customer's account, COMIS will make Customer Data available for export for a reasonable period (not less than thirty days) before deletion, except where retention is required by law or for legitimate audit purposes as described in the Privacy Policy.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">9. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
              The Service, including its software, design, workflows, trademarks, and the COMIS name and logo, is the property of Bukuma Inc. and its licensors. Nothing in these Terms grants the Customer any right, title, or interest in the Service's underlying intellectual property, other than the limited right to use the Service as set out herein.

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">10. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
              The Service may rely on third-party infrastructure providers (including cloud hosting, database, and authentication providers) to deliver its functionality. The Service may also offer optional third-party sign-in (e.g., Google). Use of such third-party sign-in is subject to that provider's own terms and privacy practices, over which COMIS has no control.

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">11. Service Availability and Support</h2>
            <p>
              COMIS will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the availability of the Service but does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation. Scheduled maintenance, third-party infrastructure outages, or connectivity issues at the Customer's location may affect availability. The Service's offline mode is designed to mitigate, but cannot eliminate, the impact of connectivity interruptions.
            </p>

          <section className="space-y-2">
            <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">12. Suspension and Termination</h2>
            <p>
              COMIS may suspend or terminate a Customer's or Authorized User's access to the Service, with or without notice, in cases including but not limited to: suspected fraud, violation of Section 6 (Acceptable Use), non-payment of applicable fees, or where required to comply with law or protect the security or integrity of the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Customer may terminate its account at any time by written request. Termination does not relieve the Customer of any payment obligations accrued prior to termination.

COMIS'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY THE CUSTOMER TO COMIS IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

            <p>
              The Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless COMIS, Bukuma Inc., its officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from: (a) the Customer's or its Authorized Users' violation of these Terms; (b) disputes between the Customer and any Seller arising from produce purchases or loans recorded through the Service; or (c) the Customer's violation of applicable law.

            <p>
              Each party agrees to protect the other's confidential information with at least the same degree of care it uses for its own confidential information of similar nature, and not to disclose such information to third parties except as necessary to perform its obligations under these Terms or as required by law.

            <p>
              COMIS's collection, use, and processing of personal data (including Seller personal data) is governed by the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. The Customer acknowledges that it is generally the data controller for Seller personal data it enters into the Service, and COMIS acts as a data processor providing the technical means for such processing, as further described in the Privacy Policy.

            <p>

COMIS provides tools to record and calculate loan balances but does not provide legal, tax, financial, or lending-compliance advice.
